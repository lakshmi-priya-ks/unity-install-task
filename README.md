Unity Engine 6 Installation & Interface Exploration

Project Name : My Project
Unity Version Used : Unity 6.3 LTS (6000.3.3f1)

Task Overview :
This project was created as part of the Unity installation and setup task. The objective was to install Unity Engine 6 using Unity Hub, create a new project, explore the Unity interface, and capture the opening screen with the project name visible.

Unity Interface Overview : 
After creating the project, I explored the following main components of the Unity Editor:

Scene View – Used to visually build and arrange game objects in the scene.
Hierarchy Window – Displays all the game objects present in the current scene.
Inspector Window – Shows properties and components of the selected object.
Project Window – Contains all assets such as scenes, scripts, materials, and settings.
Console Window – Displays errors, warnings, and debug messages.

First Impressions : 
Unity provides a powerful and well-structured development environment.
At first glance, the interface looks complex, but it is organized logically into different panels that serve specific purposes. The Scene and Hierarchy windows make it easy to understand how objects are structured, while the Inspector provides detailed control over properties. Overall, the interface feels professional and feature-rich.

Screenshot :
The opening screen screenshot of the Unity Editor with the project name visible has been included in this repository.
